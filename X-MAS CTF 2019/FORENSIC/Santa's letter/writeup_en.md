Once you download the file linked in the above description, you find an image called *challenge.png*, as shown ahead:

So, since there was a *Hide&Seek* hint on the description, we used DIIT (Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit) 1.5 (see more about it [here](http://diit.sourceforge.net/)) to try and decode it through *HideSeek* algorithm, as shown in the following image:

After that, we simply checked the *flag_chall.out* file content, as follows:

```bash
cat /root/flag_chall.out
```

The execution of such command printed the following *flag*: ```X-MAS{NOBODY:_SANTA:Hyv채채 joulua!}```.

# Flag: 
```X-MAS{NOBODY:_SANTA:Hyv채채 joulua!}```
